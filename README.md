# ppedn

ppedn reads edn from stdin and pretty prints it to stdout. It's literally < 5 lines of clojure code. YMMV.

## Usage

I like to lein uberjar this thing up and put it in my ~/bin directory, then make a shell alias that runs it with java -jar. I suppose you could also just use it with 'lein run' all the time. Pick your favourite.
